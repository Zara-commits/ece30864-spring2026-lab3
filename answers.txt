Question 1 Answer:
Agile Pros include enhanced flexibility and adaptability. Agile methedologies are more adaptable to market change.
Another advantage of using Agile is accelerated time to market. Instead of wasting too much time perfecting a product without customer feedback, Agile allows to build, test, and iterate in a faster cycle. 
It provides the ability to test market reception with real users quickly and more efficiently.
Agile Cons Include: Documentation Deficieny: Agile focuses on working software rather than detailed and comprehensive documentation so it could be confusing to follow up for a new team member joining an ongoing project.
Another con could be dependency on customer availability and stakeholders' feedback. This makes the project progress depending on others'feedback that might not always be available and slow down the progress.
